After a long time of hard consideration I decided to leave my current job. It's an awesome place to work at and the
management couldn't be better, but I feel like I am moving in a different direction.

That said: ~~I am looking for a new job~~. I have found a fitting position. A big thank you to all who shared.

[As I mentioned before](/articles/stuck-at-your-web-development-job-break-your-routine/), being stuck at my job is not
something I want. Being unhappy is something I want to avoid and looking for something else seems like the best solution.

##What I ~~am~~ was looking for
Currently I am largely interested in working on JavaScript applications, from in-browser web applications to server-side
Node.js applications. I also love automating all the things and streamlining the development process, the less coders
need to do, the better.

As much as I love working in offices, I am also open to working remote.

##Let me know if you know something

sending an [email to hi@gaya.ninja](mailto:hi@gaya.ninja). You can also [reach me through my contact page](/contact) or
