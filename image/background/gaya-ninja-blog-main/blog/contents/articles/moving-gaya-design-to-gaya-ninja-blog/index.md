Since 2008 I've been blogging with the name "Gaya Design". Which is pretty weird since I am not even blogging about
design and am not professionally a designer. It was time to make a move to a different domain and operate with a new name.

I am very proud to introduce to you: Gaya Ninja Blog.

##I am not a designer
Ever since my blog took off I felt like I was stuck with the name I once choose to host my blog on. Even before
gayadesign.com was a blog I kind of struggled with the name. It's a name I made up a long time ago when I started getting
into web design.

At that time I didn't even know whether I'd go with a design or development career. I really liked both at the time, but
went with development pretty soon, and I am glad I made that choice.

When I finally found the time to do something about this problem I began re-branding small parts of my online presence.
[My Twitter account](https://twitter.com/gayaninja) has been renamed to @GayaNinja for a while now and I launched a
website for my personal / professional profile at [http://gaya.ninja](http://gaya.ninja).

##New looks
The looks of Gaya Ninja Blog are not that different from what Gaya Design looked like. The logo is the same, and I
basically use the same colours. I did change the layout and typography, making it more fluid using a grid system.

I believe that the new looks convey my message in a better and more readable way.

##Going static
WordPress has been my blog engine on Gaya Design, but it felt like I was using it for the wrong reasons. I don't
like admin panels, configuring stuff in what seem to be endless forms and writing in a WYSIWYG editor.

Static website generators have become more popular over time, and since they come so close to front-end development work
I took the plunge and dug into different generator.

The cool thing now is that I can write my posts in the editor I work mostly in and it's blazing fast. No need for
sluggish dynamic web pages to write my content in, but plain text in combination with
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

##No traditional shared hosting
One of the reasons I wanted to make something new was to experience deployment of applications in a very different way.
Most shared hosting services just have simple FTP deployment and don't support any custom packages you might want to use.

I wanted an environment where I could deploy code to and it would build and run my application, in my case my blog.

Writing my posts in static files also means I can add them to my git repository, making it an awesome way to see how a
post evolved and not having to sync a local and remote database for my data.

##How I switched
You can read about how I switched from WordPress to a static website in another article called [Migrating from WordPress
to Wintersmith](/articles/migrating-wordpress-to-wintersmith/).

##Let me know what you think
I'd love to hear what you think about the new blog. If you have any suggestions you can tell my on
