Gaya Design is back in business and hitting hard with a redo of the 2009 script QueryLoader. I kept getting e-mails and comments about it and thought I had left it just hanging there for way too long. It had become very outdated. So here it is: version 2 of QueryLoader!

[![QueryLoader2 - Preload your images with ease](/articles/queryloader2-preload-your-images-with-ease/ql2header.jpg "QueryLoader2 - Preload your images with ease")](/articles/queryloader2-preload-your-images-with-ease/)

View the example here:  
[http://scripts.gayadesign.com/queryLoader2/](http://scripts.gayadesign.com/queryLoader2/)

Reason behind v2
----------------
QueryLoader2 is a better version of the old script posted in 2009. It serves the main purpose of preloading the images on your website by showing an overlay and a loading bar. It automatically fetches all your images and background images and preloads them before showing the webpage.

Compatibility
-------------
QueryLoader currently works in IE version 9+, Chrome, Safari and Firefox.

**No dependencies**, so *no* jQuery / Zepto / MooTools needed.

Example usage:
--------------
Include the queryloader2.min.js script in the head section of your webpage.

```html
<script src="queryloader2.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

Create a QueryLoader2 object like this for example:

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
    window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
        new QueryLoader2(document.querySelector("body"), {
            barColor: "#efefef",
            backgroundColor: "#111",
            percentage: true,
            barHeight: 1,
            minimumTime: 200,
            fadeOutTime: 1000
        });
    });
</script>
```

Use with NPM / Browserify
-------------------------
First install QueryLoader as a dependency in your project:

```
npm install queryloader2 --save-dev
```

Use it in a node / browserify project:

```javascript
var QueryLoader2 = require("queryloader2");

var loader = new QueryLoader2(document.querySelector("body"), {
    barColor: "#efefef",
    backgroundColor: "#111",
    percentage: true,
    barHeight: 1,
    minimumTime: 200,
    fadeOutTime: 1000
});
```

jQuery usage
------------
Include jQuery and `queryloader2.min.js` scripts in the header.

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="queryloader2.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

Call QueryLoader in `$(document).ready()` like this:

```javascript
$(document).ready(function () {
    $("body").queryLoader2();
});
```

Install using Bower
-------------------
```
bower install queryloader2
```

GitHub

As you might have noticed [I put my code on GitHub](https://github.com/Gaya/QueryLoader2). This makes it easier for me to manage my code and give you updates if you or me find any bugs.  
You can also [file issues](https://github.com/Gaya/QueryLoader2/issues) with the script here and fork it to make changes / fix bugs. If you send me pull requests I will take a look as to what you have changed and commit it if it is an addition.
