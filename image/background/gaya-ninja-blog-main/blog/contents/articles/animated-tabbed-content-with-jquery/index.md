A lot of websites on the Internet have tabbed content now a days. The problem I find with most of them is that most of the time they can be quite dull. For my new looks I created a container which has the ability to switch content through tabs, but with an animation. This tutorial will show you how to create your own tabbed content step by step.

In this tutorial I am going to show you some web development techniques that can be used in your next projects. This will cover some CSS, HTML and jQuery tricks.

The sources of this tutorial are downloadable here: [http://www.gayadesign.com/scripts/tabbed/tabbedContent.zip](http://www.gayadesign.com/scripts/tabbed/tabbedContent.zip)

Example of the outcome is found here: [http://www.gayadesign.com/scripts/tabbed/](http://www.gayadesign.com/scripts/tabbed/)

First thing we need is some basic HTML layout to fit what we are going to make.


```html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Tabbed content</title>
    <meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='text/html; charset=iso-8859-1' />

    <script type='text/javascript' src='http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3/jquery.min.js'></script>

    <link href='css/tabbedContent.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' />
    <script src="js/tabbedContent.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</head>

<body>

</body>
</html>
```


I already included jQuery and other files in the head section. We'll be making these files step by step in the next few minutes.

Next thing we need to do is create the structure of the document. What we need is a container with the tabs and a container which the content will that switch if we change tabs.  
 As a nice feature to enhance this all we'll use a tab background that will move to the choice the user makes. While this tab moves, the content will also change to the selected tab.

For this we need a container containing the tabs and the background, a container containing the content and container that prevents the content to be shown prematurely.

Take a look at the following code:


```html
<div class='tabbed_content'>
    <div class='tabs'>
        <div class='moving_bg'>
            &nbsp;
        </div>
        <span class='tab_item'>
        Tab one
        </span>
        <span class='tab_item'>
        Tab two
        </span>
        <span class='tab_item'>
        Tab three
        </span>
        <span class='tab_item'>
        Tab four
        </span>
    </div>

    <div class='slide_content'>
        <div class='tabslider'>

            <!-- content goes here -->

        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```


It's time to do a little styling to the tabs section and the overall container. Note that in the next part I am going to use an image which is included in [the source archive](http://www.gayadesign.com/scripts/tabbed/tabbedContent.zip). This will enhance the looks of the tabbed container.

This following CSS will make the tabs appear as tabs:


```css
.tabbed_content {
    background-color: #000000;
    width: 620px;
}

.tabs {
    height: 62px;
    position: relative;
}

.tabs .moving_bg {
    background-color:#7F822A;
    background-image:url(../images/arrow_down_green.gif);
    background-position: bottom left;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    left: 0;
    padding: 15px;
    padding-bottom: 29px;
    position: absolute;
    width: 125px;
    z-index: 190;
}

.tabs .tab_item {
    display: block;
    float: left;
    padding: 15px;
    width: 125px;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-align: center;
    z-index: 200;
    position: relative;
    cursor: pointer;
}
```


Note that the tab container has a position of *relative* to make the moving background position to it. Now we can easily move the moving background using the *left *property.

In the next part we are going to add the first few lines of Javascript to the tabbedContent.js file to create a mouseover effect on the tab items.

Use this code as a skeleton:


```javascript
var TabbedContent = {
    init: function() {

    },

    slideContent: function(obj) {

    }
}

$(document).ready(function() {
    TabbedContent.init();
});
```


This code is will execute the init function once the page is loaded.

Now we need to make is so that the moving background moves to the tab item which is hovered on. Implement the following code:


```javascript
$(".tab_item").mouseover(function() {

    var background = $(this).parent().find(".moving_bg");

    $(background).stop().animate({
        left: $(this).position()['left']
    }, {
        duration: 300
    });

    TabbedContent.slideContent($(this));

});
```


This will make all the items with the class **tab_item** behave as if it was a tab. It also moves the moving background to the right position, matching the *left *property with that of the tab.

`TabbedContent.slideContent($(this));` will make the content switch in a few steps. We'll get to that.

Next up is creating the content and it's CSS. The content goes in the place we put **.


```html
<ul>
    <li>
        This matches the first tab
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        This matches the second tab
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        This matches the third tab
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        This matches the fourth tab
    </li>
</ul>
```


And the matching CSS:


```css
.tabbed_content .slide_content {
    overflow: hidden;
    background-color: #000000;
    padding: 20px 0 20px 20px;
    position: relative;
    width: 600px;
}

.tabslider {
    width: 5000px;
}

.tabslider ul {
    float: left;
    width: 560px;
    margin: 0px;
    padding: 0px;
    margin-right: 40px;
}

.tabslider ul a {
    color: #ffffff;
    text-decoration: none;
}

.tabslider ul a:hover {
    color: #aaaaaa;
}

.tabslider ul li {
    padding-bottom: 7px;
}
```


Note that the content has two containers. One is for the overall wrapping and the other for making the content move as we hover over the items.

The top container has an overflow of hidden, which makes any content that goes out of it's limits hidden. The container below that will hold the content that will be hidden.

Now we are going to make the content scroll to the right position as we did with the tabs.

It's time to fill up the **slideContent **function:


```javascript
var margin = $(obj).parent().parent().find(".slide_content").width();
margin = margin * ($(obj).prevAll().size() - 1);
margin = margin * -1;

$(obj).parent().parent().find(".tabslider").stop().animate({
    marginLeft: margin + "px"
}, {
    duration: 300
});
```


The margin needed for the slider to move is calculated in this function. It has been made so that you can change the widths of several containers in the result, it will scroll to the right position automatically.

Good luck with making your own tabbed content in your future projects.
