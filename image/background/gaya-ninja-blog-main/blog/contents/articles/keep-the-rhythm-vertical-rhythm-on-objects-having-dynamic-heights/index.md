That is a lot in one sentence, but basically it explains it all. Maintaining a vertical rhythm is hard enough by itself and takes a lot of time and thinking to accomplish.

The problem with maintaining a proper rhythm are objects (like images) that have dynamic heights. Like the images on this blog, or when you have clients uploading their content which isn't perfectly resized / cropped to your line-height.

For this I created a jQuery plugin that fixes the rhythm: Keep the Rhythm.

[![Keep the Rhythm: Vertical rhythm on objects having dynamic heights](/articles/keep-the-rhythm-vertical-rhythm-on-objects-having-dynamic-heights/keep-the-rhythm.jpg "Keep the Rhythm: Vertical rhythm on objects having dynamic heights")](/articles/keep-the-rhythm-vertical-rhythm-on-objects-having-dynamic-heights/ "Keep the Rhythm: Vertical rhythm on objects having dynamic heights")

Rhythms are sexy and make the web a better place. It makes it way easier to read the page and it will look very balanced at the same time. It might be a bit of extra work to create a vertical rhythm, but it's really worth the time.

What is a vertical rhythm?
--------------------------

Vertical rhythms make sure the text and elements on your page are aligned to a baseline rhythm. Look at it as if you had a notebook with line, these are the guides we write on.

You can get the concept of vertical alignment pretty quick when you [take a look at the example](http://www.gayadesign.com/scripts/keeptherhythm/).

How can I create a vertical rhythm?
-----------------------------------

There are tons of [website where you can generate your vertical rhythm CSS](http://drewish.com/tools/vertical-rhythm) so it does all the calculation for you. What I like to use is [Compass' vertical rhythm mixins](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/typography/vertical_rhythm/). Still not using Compass? This might be a great opportunity to. Vertical rhythms are a breeze when you use Compass.

What does Keep the Rhythm do?
-----------------------------

Maintaining a vertical rhythm using line-heights is pretty doable, but there are also inline and block elements that don't have their heights set to a rhythm. Of course the most pesky ones in this case are images.

Imagine you have a baseline of 24 pixels and the image is 50 pixels tall, this means your image is 2 pixel too tall, or 22 pixels too short. Keep the Rhythm will fill this gap for you with paddings (or margins) so the elements has a perfect rhythmic height.

### It fixes this:

### To this:

![Perfect Rhythm](/articles/keep-the-rhythm-vertical-rhythm-on-objects-having-dynamic-heights/perfect-rhythm.jpg)

It does not only fix images, it also fixes block elements like `iframes`. Which will come in handy when embedding media from Youtube or Vimeo.

Responsive.
-----------

This script fixes the vertical alignment of elements that get resized because of a responsive layout too. This will work on very object that changes size on the window's `resize()` event.

How to use?
-----------

First thing you want to do is to include jQuery and Keep the Rhythm in your webpage. Place the following code in your `` tag or before the end of your ``.


```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/js/jquery-1.9.1.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/js/jquery.keeptherhythm.js"></script>
```


Then, on `$(document).ready();` or `$(window).load();` call the function using a selector. Define the baseline in the options.


```javascript
$(document).ready(function () {
    $("div.rhythm").keepTheRhythm({
        baseLine: 20
    });
});

$(window).load(function () {
    $("article img").keepTheRhythm({
        baseLine: 20
    });
});
```


That's basically it! The padding will now be added automatically.

Use window.load event for images
--------------------------------

Because images get their height and width set after they have been loaded it's best if you use the `.load()` event of the `window`. It's best to always perform the rhythm fixes after this event so you can be sure that the images have their heights set.

I want to use margin instead of padding
---------------------------------------

Well, you can. Just pass an extra option value to the function call:


```javascript
$("element").keepTheRhythm({
    spacing: "margin"
});
```


The element shouldn't be aligned to the center
----------------------------------------------

There is also an option for that, it can be "top", "center" or "bottom":


```javascript
$("element").keepTheRhythm({
    verticalAlignment: "top"
});
```


Conclusion
----------

Hopefully this little plugin will help you maintain a perfect rhythm and keeps your readers happy. Let me know what you think and [contribute on GitHub](https://github.com/Gaya/jQuery--Keep-the-Rhythm/issues "issues on Github") if anything is wrong with the script.
