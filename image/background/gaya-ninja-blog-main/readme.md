#Gaya Ninja Blog
This repository serves as a look into the workings of [Gaya Ninja Blog](https://blog.gaya.ninja). It shows the flow it
used to build the blog once it has been published to my dokku server.

##Suggestions
If you have any suggestions how I can improve the build process or inner workings of my blog, please add an issue or
pull request.
