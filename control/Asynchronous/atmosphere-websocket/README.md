## Welcome to Atmosphere: The Asynchronous WebSocket/Comet Framework
The Atmosphere Framework contains client and server side components for building Asynchronous Web Applications. The majority of [popular frameworks](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere/wiki/Atmosphere-PlugIns-and-Extensions) are either supporting Atmosphere or supported natively by the framework. The Atmosphere Framework supports all major [Browsers and Servers](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere/wiki/Supported-WebServers-and-Browsers)

Follow us on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/atmo_framework) or get the latest news [here](http://async-io.org)

Atmosphere transparently supports WebSockets, Server Side Events (SSE), Long-Polling, HTTP Streaming (Forever frame) and JSONP.
