# AngularJS Menu Aim

This repository is based on Ben Kamens [jQuery-menu-aim](https://github.com/kamens/jQuery-menu-aim). It converts Ben's original implementation into a more Angular-friendly implemntation.

## How To Use:

- Load the directive into your application
- Load the `app.flyout` module into your application
- Load the `main.css` file into your application
- Create a simple function to hide and reveal the initial menu

Load up the example `index.html` using something such as Node.js `http-server` to see the working example.

## Notes:

The project is very CSS and HTML dependent. It is also built using bootstrap, if you remove or change any of these, expect it to break. Use the example as a starting point, and build your custom solution out using that.
