<div class="container">
    <div class="col-sm-10">
        <div class="lead">Click the &quot;Personnel&quot; tab.</div>
        <ul>
            <li> Drill down through the Personnel states until you are editing an employee record.</li>
            <li> Modify some data on the employee record. There is intentionally no save button.</li>
            <li> Click the &quot;Inventory&quot; tab and drill down the tab&apos;s states until you are
                viewing a Product.
            </li>
            <li> Click the &quot;Personnel tab&quot;. Deep State Redirect sends you back to the employee
                record
                state, while Sticky State preserves the DOM and $scope exactly as you left it (including scroll
                position, etc).
            </li>
            <li> Click the &quot;Inventory&quot; tab. Deep State Redirect sends you back to the product
                record,
                and Sticky State preserves the DOM and $scope.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each sticky state has its own named ui-view.
            This demo hides the preserved DOM for inactivated states using the ng-show directive.
            The DOM for inactivated states can be viewed using your browsers dev tools.
        </p>
<pre>
&lt;div ui-view="peopletab" ng-show="$state.includes('top.people')" class="col-sm-8"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div ui-view="invtab"    ng-show="$state.includes('top.inv')"    class="col-sm-8"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div ui-view="custtab"   ng-show="$state.includes('top.cust')"   class="col-sm-8"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
