                AngularJS has two phases for boostrapping and launching an application, the <code>config</code>
                phase and the <code>runtime</code> phase.
            </p>

            <p>
                UI-Router exposes a <code>$stateProvider</code> for declaring application states
                during the <code>config</code> phase. Once the application enters the runtime phase,
                <code>$stateProvider</code> is usually no longer available.
            </p>

            <p>
                FutureStates are <em>placeholders</em> for states (or entire trees of states), whose full definition is
                not yet known. FutureStates are declared at config time (or optionally at runtime), and replaced with
                a full UI-Router state when navigated to.  The full UI-Router state is registered with $stateProvider.

                    When it finds a placeholder that may map to the missing state, it pretends that the transition

                Late binding of states at runtime allows you to load states from a file, or from a serverside
                API.  However, late binding alone does not solve the problem of delaying the loading of JS code and
                templates until they are needed.  You must use another tool to dynamically load your states templates
                and controllers, and add them to the angular environment.  
            </p>
            
            <p>
                FutureStates is agnostic to how to load code on demand. It does not itself implement delayed
                loading of state source code (controllers, views).  However, an example is included for loading code
                on demand, using <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a> and
                <a href="http://marcoslin.github.io/angularAMD/#/home">AngularAMD</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                An example StateFactory called ngloadStateFactory is provided in ui-router-extras which uses
                ngload from the <a href="http://marcoslin.github.io/angularAMD/#/home">AngularAMD</a> project to load a
                module on demand. <a href="http://marcoslin.github.io/angularAMD/#/home">AngularAMD</a> uses RequireJS
                to load and inject angular code into the DI system.
