                A Sticky State is the root of a UI-Router state tree which can continue running even after it is "exited".  The
                sticky state (and its children) have a different lifecycle than normal states. The DOM, <code>$scope</code>,
                and controller of a Sticky State (and all activated substates) are retained until one of two things
                happen:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The parent of the sticky state is exited</li>
                <li>The parent of the sticky state is directly activated</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                If a sibling of the sticky state (or a child of a sibling) is activated, the sticky state tree will
                become &quot;inactivated&quot;, until the rules above cause it to exit.
            </p>

            <p>
                This feature is based on a &quot;<strong>tabs</strong>&quot; use case.  The use case requires that the states
                for a tab in the application does not get exited when switching to one of the other tabs.  The user should
                be able to switch back and forth between tabs without any interruption in their workflow.  The URL
                should reflect only the state tree of the active tab.
            </p>

            <p> For the tabs use case, Sticky States work best when also marked as Deep State Redirect </p>
