            <p>The <code>$previousState</code> remembers the previous state and allows you to transition to it.  
                It also provides an api to apply a memo name to a previous state, then transition to the named memo. </p>
            
            <p>This service can be useful if you transition into a complex workflow, then wish to transition back to the 
                original entry point when the workflow is completed.</p>
            
            <p><code>$previousState</code> should not be used inside $stateChange event handlers.  <small>The reason for this
                is that $previousState uses those events internally, and the events callbacks could be run out-of-order.</small>  
                Inside $stateChangeStart and $stateChangeSuccess handlers, you can access the fromState and fromParams 
                function parameters directly.</p>
