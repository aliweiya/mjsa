## Prerequisites

- Node
- Npm
- Gulp
- Bower

### Installation

    > git clone git@github.com:tthew/resume.git
    > cd resume
    > npm install && bower install

#### Running the development server

    > gulp serve

#### Running the test suite

Ok, so the test suite is fairly thin on the ground, currently comprising of only a handful of unit tests. Imagining for a moment that we actually had good coverage you would do something like this to run the full suite (unit + e2e):

    > gulp test

Or like this to run either `unit` or `e2e` tests in isolation:
    
    # Unit Tests
    > gulp test:unit
    
    # Integration Tests
    > gulp test:e2e
