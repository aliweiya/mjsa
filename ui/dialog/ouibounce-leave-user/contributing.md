### Getting OuiBounce to Work Locally
To get OuiBounce ready locally you'll need to:

- Clone the repo
- Run `npm install`
- Make sure `gulp` is installed globally
    - You can do that by running `npm install -g gulp`
- Open the index file in the "test" folder
    - Note: Cookies won't work if you simply open the file. You'll need to have a server ready to serve the page. The easies way is to run this: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

### Dev Build
To minify OuiBounce run `gulp build` from the command line.
