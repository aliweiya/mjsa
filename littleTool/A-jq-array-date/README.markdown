jQuery methods
==============

A set of files to provide additional functionality to built in JavaScript objects
(e.g. Array, Date and String) for use with jQuery.

These methods were previously hosted in the main jQuery repository but that is now
reserved for core jQuery code so I've imported their history to github for future
hosting and development.
